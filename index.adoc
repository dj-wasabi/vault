= Consul

== Introduction

Container running Alpine 3.4 and Vault 0.6.2.

== Container

=== User

Vault is running as a non-root user: `vault`. There is not really a need for running Vault as root.

We do have to do something as root. We have to lock the memory so it won't be swapped to disk. One of the actions in the Dockerfile is executing the `setcap cap_ipc_lock=+ep`. This allows the process to lock memory, even if we are running the process as a non-root user.
